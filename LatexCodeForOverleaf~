\section{Background}

Among Distributed Systems, the Event-based Systems(EBSs) are
used to disseminate event notifications on the occurrence of an
event, generated by an event producer. The disseminated event
notification is delivered to the event consumer, which only subscribes
to an event of particular interest. The event notifications are delivered to the event consumers based on a match/satisfying criteria between the subscription and event notification. The EBSs
are predominantly used in the supply chain, new ticker and share
market. These applications are widely distributed, with heterogeneous components making up a system-wide architecture. An event
detected \&/or generated by a component, is propagated through
event-notification service to the event consumer. The current publish/subscribe systems utilizes a common context, to infer an event
produced by an event producer and, subscription subscribed by an
event consumer. The producer and consumers may often differ in
their respective contexts. And the differing contexts between producers and consumers leads to a difference in the interpretation of
the event. Below in the related work section, ACTrESS suggests a
solution to this differing context.

\section{Related Work}
ACTrESS suggests automatic contextual transformation for differ-
ing contexts in Event-Based Software Systems at runtime, transpar-
ent to end users and also, ACTrESS overcomes major challenges
related to contextual transformations. In ACTrESS, the Producer
Context is transformed to Root Context (at the broker the produc-
er/publisher is connected to) and the Root Context is transformed
to Consumer Context at the fringe of the broker network(i.e., at last
broker the consumer is connected to).

\section{Problem Statement}

The ACTrESS prototype implements greedy algorithm and works
best in most cases. But in ACTrESS, there may result unnecessary
work in spite of producer and consumer being in the same context.
For instance, in a channel-based pub/sub system and Topic-based
pub/sub system. And also, certain topologies such as mobile net-
works where the clients(i.e., producer/consumer) move from one
broker to another, the same transformation (Producer Context Root
Context Consumer Context) performed in the former broker has to
be performed again on the latter broker, where the client may newly
join. We try to address this with our heuristic in the below section.

\section{Our Approach}

Our approach focuses on, contextual transformation with respect
to taking into account the number of transformations to be performed and the number of messages generated in the network due
to the transformations. Our approach proposes to perform contextual transformation, at the first broker with a subscriber in different
context. Below listed are the different cases in order to illustrate
our approach.

\section{Discussion of Experimental Uncertainty}

The accepted value (periodic table) is \SI{24.3}{\gram\per\mole} \cite{Smith:2012qr}. The percentage discrepancy between the accepted value and the result obtained here is 1.3\%. Because only a single measurement was made, it is not possible to calculate an estimated standard deviation.

The most obvious source of experimental uncertainty is the limited precision of the balance. Other potential sources of experimental uncertainty are: the reaction might not be complete; if not enough time was allowed for total oxidation, less than complete oxidation of the magnesium might have, in part, reacted with nitrogen in the air (incorrect reaction); the magnesium oxide might have absorbed water from the air, and thus weigh ``too much." Because the result obtained is close to the accepted value it is possible that some of these experimental uncertainties have fortuitously cancelled one another.

\section{Answers to Definitions}

\begin{enumerate}
\begin{item}
The \emph{atomic weight of an element} is the relative weight of one of its atoms compared to C-12 with a weight of 12.0000000$\ldots$, hydrogen with a weight of 1.008, to oxygen with a weight of 16.00. Atomic weight is also the average weight of all the atoms of that element as they occur in nature.
\end{item}
\begin{item}
The \emph{units of atomic weight} are two-fold, with an identical numerical value. They are g/mole of atoms (or just g/mol) or amu/atom.
\end{item}
\begin{item}
\emph{Percentage discrepancy} between an accepted (literature) value and an experimental value is
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\mathrm{experimental\;result} - \mathrm{accepted\;result}}{\mathrm{accepted\;result}}
\end{equation*}
\end{item}
\end{enumerate}
